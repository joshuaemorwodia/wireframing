# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It is usually created in black and white or grayscale, focusing on layout and structure instead of colors, fonts, or images.

Think of it as the **blueprint** of a digital product.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process because it:

- Helps define the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
- Allows designers and developers to plan and discuss functionality early.
- Saves time and effort by spotting issues before development begins.
- Makes communication easier between stakeholders, designers, and developers.

## Common Tools for Wireframing

Some popular tools used for wireframing include:

- Figma
- Adobe XD
- Balsamiq
- Sketch
- Pencil Project

## Conclusion

Wireframing is an essential part of any digital project. It simplifies ideas, improves communication, and ensures everyone is on the same page before development begins.
